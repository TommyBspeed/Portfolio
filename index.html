            <p> Hi everyone! And welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Tommy Boileau, I am a former professional racecar driver who had the incredible opportunity to get paid to drive racecars all over the world for the past 12 years of my life. I have also always had a passion for computers, and have been fascinated with them ever since I was young. I decided to make the leap full time into computer programming and coding, and am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp through The University of Denver. Outside of racing and coding, I am a big hockey fan (GO AVS!) and play mens league hockey twice a week, I am a golf fanatic, I love video games, and I have a wonderful dog named Ricky Bobby with my beautiful Fiance Abbey.Follow me on my journey as I make my way into the professional workplace and grow as a developer!

            <p>As you would expect, someone who is new to the world of coding doesn't have that impressive of a portfolio. However, I am learing quickly through the bootcamp and will continue to update this section regularly! In the meantime, check out some of my early work below.</p>
